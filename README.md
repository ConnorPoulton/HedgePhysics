Why did LakeFeperd make this:

Fore the future. LakeFeperd need a good 3D general character controller, and my frustration with the fact LakeFeperd can't find a good one lead LakeFeperd to this. LakeFeperd did take a break from working on Spark to make this, as LakeFeperd felt like LakeFeperd needed to after working on that game for months. Hopefully it will be worth it.

Note: The exe will crash when loading a stage after going trough the stage complete screen, I've no idea why.
Also, shields may not show up in 0.7's playable build but they will in-game, I've no idea why this is happening.
